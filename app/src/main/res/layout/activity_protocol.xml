When the order is accepted by the restaurant you will receive a notification that your order is “has been accepted”. The contract for the supply of the meal(s) ordered through our service between you and the Partner Restaurant will be formed once you have received the notification that your order has been accepted. Once the restaurant has accepted your order, the restaurant has sole responsibility for your order. You (the Customer) must resolve any dispute regarding your Order directly with the Restaurant. In some cases EatAway may intervene to resolve the dispute as a gesture of goodwill. We work closely with Partner Restaurants and it is extremely important that they adhere to our standards and help us maintain our reputation. Please contact us via email or telephone if you have any comments relating our Partner Restaurants.

Changing an Order: Once your order has been submitted and accepted by the restaurant you will not be able to change or cancel your order on our mobile Application. If you wish to change or cancel your order it is your responsibility to directly contact the Restaurant or phone our customer support team who will attempt contact the restaurant on your behalf. However there is no guarantee that the Restaurant will agree to change or cancel the order as they may have already started to prepare your order.

Restaurant failure to accept order: Once your order has been received we will process your order and send it to the Restaurant. When your selected restaurant has accepted the order you will receive a notification alerting you that the order “has been received”. You can view how your order is processing at any time through the application. Restaurants have the option to decline orders at any time due to weather conditions, because they are too busy or any other reasons. We strongly encourage all Partner Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate directly with the Customer prior to declining any order. In the case that the restaurant does reject your order we will notify you (generally via the APP) as soon as possible.

Delivery of order: Estimations for delivery times are provided by the restaurants and can be viewed on our Application. These delivery times are only estimates and unfortunately sometimes things do not go to plan because factors such as weather, traffic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances may prevent restaurants from achieving their targeted delivery time. Therefore neither EatAway nor the Restaurants can guarantee that the food will be delivered within the estimated time. EatAway is not responsible for any complaints about Restaurants or the products they provide. All orders placed via our service are prepared and delivered by the Restaurant; all food preparation deliveries are the sole responsibility of the restaurant accepting the order. To the full extent permitted by Australian law, EatAway accepts no liability in the food preparation and delivery undertaken by the Restaurant accepting the order."/>
